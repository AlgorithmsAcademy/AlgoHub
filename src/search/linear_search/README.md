# 🧠 Algorithm Name

## 📝 Description

Brief explanation of what the algorithm does and its purpose. Keep it beginner-friendly.

## 💾 Time Complexity

| Case  | Complexity |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Best  | $\Omega()$ |
| Worst | $O()$      |

## 💾 Space Complexity

Describe the space complexity.

## 💡 Intuition

Describe the high-level idea behind how the algorithm works. Use metaphors, visual cues, or simple reasoning to make it intuitive.

## 🧾 Pseudocode

Pseudocode syntax, not code. Use loops, conditions, and indentation to mimic logic flow.

## 📈 Time Complexity Analysis

Give a step-by-step breakdown of how you derive the time complexity. Include summation formulas, case analysis, and any assumptions.

- ** Worst case **:
  Description + math if applicable

- ** Best case **:
  Description + math if applicable

- ** Average case **:
  Description + math
