# 🧠 _Algorithm Name_

## 📝 Description

_Add a short description of the algorithm, including its purpose, category (e.g., sorting, graph traversal), and any notable properties (e.g., recursive, greedy, divide-and-conquer)._

## ⏰ Time Complexity

| Case    | Complexity                 |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| Best    | _e.g.,_ $\Omega(n)$        |
| Average | _e.g.,_ $\Theta(n \log n)$ |
| Worst   | _e.g.,_ $O(n^2)$           |

## 💾 Space Complexity
