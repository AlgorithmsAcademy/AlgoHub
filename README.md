This repo collects common algorithms & data structures that are useful for interviews â€” each with

1. a **written and/or visual explanation**
2. a **python implementation**
3. **test cases**

## Installation

1. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - a fast Python package installer and resolver. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) for installation instructions.

2. Clone the repository and setup the environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlgorithmsAcademy/AlgoHub.git
   cd AlgoHub
   uv sync --all-extras
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Contribution

### Guidelines

- **Coding Standards:**
  Follow clean and consistent coding practices. Use meaningful variable and function names.

- **Document Your Code:**
  Ensure all functions have clear and concise comments/description.

- **Test Your Changes:**
  While we understand that fully testing this library may be challenging, ensure your code works as intended before submitting. Focus on edge cases and confirm that your changes integrate smoothly with existing functionality.

- **Be Respectful**:
  Engage in discussions respectfully and constructively.

- **Follow The File Structure Template**: Each Algorithm should have its own file in **scr** with: A README based on the template and the python file. Parallel to that you should create another file inside tests with a python file torun the tests and a YAML file to store the tests cases.
